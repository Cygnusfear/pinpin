**CHARACTER INFORMATION:**
${JSON.stringify(characters, null, 2)}

**CHARACTER USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:**
- **Ability Scores (attributes)**: Each character has six core abilities that determine their natural aptitude:
  - Strength: Physical power for combat, lifting, breaking things
  - Dexterity: Agility, reflexes, stealth, ranged attacks
  - Constitution: Health, endurance, resistance to poison/disease
  - Intelligence: Reasoning, memory, investigation, arcane knowledge
  - Wisdom: Perception, insight, survival, divine magic
  - Charisma: Force of personality, persuasion, intimidation, social situations
  
- **Class & Archetype System**: 
  - **Class**: Defines what the character "likes" (their interests/specialization) and primary abilities
  - **Archetype**: Provides ability score modifiers that reflect physical/mental build (Scholar, Brute, Charmer, etc.)
  - **Final Scores**: Base attributes + archetype modifiers = character's effective abilities
  
- **Inventory System**: Characters can only use items they possess. Each item has:
  - **Name**: The item's designation
  - **Properties**: Flexible object containing description, type, rarity, and special effects
  - Consider item types: equipment, consumable, misc
  - Consider rarity: common, uncommon, rare, legendary
  - **AUTOMATIC ACQUISITION**: When characters take, grab, pick up, receive, are given, are handed, pocket, or otherwise acquire any item through their actions or interactions, automatically add it to their inventory using items_gained. Do NOT require explicit "put in inventory" statements.
  
- **Abilities System**: Characters have special abilities beyond basic actions:
  - **Name**: The ability's designation  
  - **Properties**: Contains description, type (active/passive), cooldown, and mechanical effects
  - Active abilities may have usage limitations or cooldowns
  - Passive abilities provide ongoing benefits
  
- **Currency System**: Track character wealth across three coin types:
  - **Gold**: Most valuable (1 gold = 10 silver = 100 copper)
  - **Silver**: Medium value (1 silver = 10 copper)
  - **Copper**: Base currency unit
  
- **Contextual Application**: 
  - Match character actions to their strengths (class interests + high ability scores)
  - Consider archetype when describing physical appearance and mannerisms
  - Reference specific inventory items when characters attempt to use them
  - Apply ability score modifiers to determine action success probability
  - Create opportunities for characters to use their special abilities
  - Factor in currency when dealing with merchants, bribes, or economic challenges`;

**DICE ROLL MECHANICS:**
- **World Roll**: ${worldRoll} (determines how challenging/powerful the world response should be)
  - 1-5: World is favorable, challenges are mild, outcomes favor the characters
  - 6-10: World is neutral, balanced challenges and outcomes
  - 11-15: World is challenging, moderate obstacles and complications
  - 16-20: World is harsh, significant challenges and powerful opposition

${
  characterRoll !== null
    ? `- **Character Roll**: ${characterRoll} (from the character's action)
  - 1-5: Character action fails badly, negative consequences
  - 6-10: Character action partially succeeds or has mixed results
  - 11-15: Character action succeeds as intended
  - 16-20: Character action succeeds spectacularly, with additional benefits

**ROLL INTERACTION**: Use both rolls together - the character roll determines how well they execute their action, while the world roll determines how the world responds to that action. A high character roll with a high world roll creates dramatic tension. A low character roll with a low world roll might lead to comedic mishaps rather than serious consequences.

**NARRATIVE INTEGRATION**: Weave the dice results naturally into your storytelling:
- Don't explicitly mention the dice rolls or numbers
- Let the outcomes speak for themselves through vivid descriptions
- Use the rolls to determine the degree of success/failure and world reaction
- Create interesting complications or benefits based on the roll combinations`

**CORE PRINCIPLES:**
- **Character-Driven**: The location should reflect the character's class, abilities, and background
- **Backstory Integration**: The location should naturally connect to the provided backstory
- **Immersive Detail**: Create rich, atmospheric descriptions that engage the senses
- **Adventure Potential**: The location should suggest multiple paths for exploration and story development

**LOCATION DESIGN GUIDELINES:**
- **Atmosphere**: Consider the character's class and archetype when setting the mood
- **Practical Elements**: Include features that the character can interact with using their abilities
- **Story Hooks**: Embed elements that connect to the backstory and suggest future adventures
- **Accessibility**: Ensure the location has multiple potential exits for exploration
- **Scale**: Create an appropriately sized location that feels substantial but not overwhelming

**CHARACTER INTEGRATION:**
- A **Barbarian** might start in a wilderness camp, tribal settlement, or rugged tavern
- A **Wizard** could begin in a library, magical academy, or arcane laboratory
- A **Rogue** might start in an underground hideout, busy marketplace, or shadowy alley
- A **Cleric** could begin at a temple, shrine, or pilgrimage site
- Consider the character's **abilities** and **inventory** when adding interactive elements
- Factor in the character's **wealth** when describing the location's economic level

**EDGE GENERATION REQUIREMENTS:**
- Generate 2-4 edges (exits) from this location
- Each edge represents an unexplored direction the character could travel
- Edge descriptions should hint at what lies beyond without revealing specifics
- All edges should have isExplored: false and no destinationId since they're unexplored
- Consider the location's context when describing edge directions (e.g., mountain paths go up/down, forest clearings connect to deeper woods)
